# AI Group Application Information
This is the document including all the information applicants need to complete the application process of the AI and Machine Learning Interest Group.

Please take this application process seriously, of course this isn't like a college application, but it is still important to try your best at completing the following tasks.

**Please email your FINAL PRODUCT to aaron01px2026@saschina.org PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 1ST.**

## Prior Briefing
An Overview of the Process: This is a relatively casual project, but should still be completed at your best effort. The application consists of three parts:
1. Read the **COMPLETE** document of this GitHub page
2. Complete the mandatory answer questions
3. Choose one research/project question to complete

What You are Applying for: This application can lead to three results.
1. Group Member: You are accepted as an official member of this interest group. (More information below)
2. Group Associate Member: You are an associate member, but not official member of the interest group. (More information below)
3. N/A: You are unfortunately rejected from being either a group member or group associate member. (very unlikely if you are at all interested in this field)

## Disclaimer
If you have concerns about the prerequisites of applying, well, there aren't many! We understand that you may have concerns about the coding and math needed to dive into machine learning. We assure you that to apply, you will not need any of that.

***NOTE: We will still inquire on some information about your coding and math experience, but just remember it is not the main focus AT ALL***

----

## Mandatory Answer Questions
Every applicant must answer these following questions. Please organize your answers in an organized PDF document, this should only take 5-10 minutes.

1. What is your **name**, **grade level**, and if you will be here for the 2024-2025 school year.
2. **Briefly** tell us about your coding experience. (<100 words)
3. What is your current math level in school.
4. **Briefly** explain why you decided to apply. (<100 words)


## Choice Research & Project Questions
Every applicant can choose **ONE** out of the following four options to complete. The product to demonstrate your findings is up to you (e.g. research paper, video, audio, etc...).

1. Research an area of interest for you where AI is implemented. (e.g. AI in art, AI in Vehicles, AI in healthcare, etc...). What are the main AI models offered as products, what do they do?

2. Explain what a neural network is when regarding machine learning, their applications in machine learning, advantages, and disadvantages.

3. Research an area where you believe AI will be advantageous in the future, why is that? Give us your predictions and how machine learning models might help those areas.

4. What jobs and occupations might be eliminated in the future because of AI? Which ones disapear first, second, last, and why is it important to learn how machine learning works for the future?

***The extensiveness of your answer has no requirement.***


## Optional Task
This task is not required, but can be of benefit for your application. Answering the following question will further help us understand your self-learning abilities, as well as introduce you to some concepts that will be taught in the future. 

Answer this question:
- Explain some of the popular and useful python libraries for coding **machine learning** models. What are they called? What are their uses?

***The extensiveness of your answer has no requirement.***

----

## Concluding Points
Here is the end of all application questions and workload.

A reminder, what we are looking for aren't exactly people who know 10 different coding languages, and are studying calculus BC. Instead we want people are very much interested in this area, and are willing to invest their time. Some qualities we may look for include: self-guided learning, time management, time management, and self dicipline.

**Please email your FINAL PRODUCT to aaron01px2026@saschina.org PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 1ST.**

GOOD LUCK!!! Email or WeChat Aaron or Douglas if you have any questions

## Group Member Information
**6 Applicants will be chosen to be official group members.**

If you are accepted as an official group member, congrats! Here are some information for you:

You will have the rest of this school year 2023-2024, to complete learning material our officers and mentors provide. You can work at your own pace, but should complete everything at good quality and in timely fashion.

Next school year, you will work with other group members to complete the first machine learning model!

Role:
- 2023-2024 school year, you are recommended to have 1h per week at least, available for this group's work. (time is flexible, so don't worry too much)
- Stay invested in this group and its projects as much as you can. (if you are concerned with anything, reach out to our officers at any moment)
- Club members receive professional mentoring from Professor Cheng, as well as trips to Fudan University for training their ML models.

## Group Associete Member Information
**No set number of associetes has been decided yet**

As an associete member, you will unfortunately not have as much involvement as official group members, but there are still many valuable benefits.

Role:
- You will be provided similar learning material as group members. There is no time limit to when you complete everything, and you may work at your own pace.
- You will not be able to work on the group's machine learning models during the school year, but our officers and mentors will provide you with other projects (e.g. online projects from kaggle.com) for you to work through by yourself.
- Being an associete member, and having outstanding accomplishments will GREATLY boost your chances of being an offical member next application.
- If a club member is seen as unfit, or decides to retract their position at anytime, an outstanding associete member will replace them.

***NOTE: Seniors will likely be chosen as associete members, as they won't be here for the next school year and therefore won't be able to work with other group members.***
